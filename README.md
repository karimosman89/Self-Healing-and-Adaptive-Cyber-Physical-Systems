# Self-Healing and Adaptive Cyber-Physical Systems

## Project Overview

This project explores the development of self-healing and adaptive capabilities within Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). CPS are integrations of computation, networking, and physical processes, often found in critical infrastructure, smart manufacturing, and healthcare. Ensuring their reliability, resilience, and security is paramount. This repository focuses on designing and implementing mechanisms that allow CPS to detect anomalies, diagnose faults, and autonomously recover from failures, as well as adapt to changing environmental conditions or operational demands.

## Problem Statement

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are increasingly complex and interconnected, making them vulnerable to various disruptions, including hardware failures, software bugs, cyberattacks, and environmental disturbances. Traditional fault tolerance and security measures are often reactive and may not be sufficient to maintain continuous operation and integrity in dynamic and hostile environments. The challenge lies in creating CPS that can autonomously identify and mitigate issues, recover from unexpected events, and optimize their performance without human intervention. This project aims to address these challenges by developing advanced self-healing and adaptive frameworks that enhance the resilience, robustness, and trustworthiness of CPS across diverse applications.

## Features

*   **Anomaly Detection:** Real-time monitoring and AI-driven algorithms to identify deviations from normal system behavior.
*   **Fault Diagnosis:** Automated identification of the root cause of detected anomalies.
*   **Self-Recovery Mechanisms:** Implementation of autonomous repair and reconfiguration strategies to restore system functionality.
*   **Adaptive Control:** Dynamic adjustment of system parameters and behaviors in response to changing conditions or threats.
*   **Security Hardening:** Integration of self-healing capabilities to counter cyber threats and maintain system integrity.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** Primary programming language.
*   **TensorFlow/PyTorch:** For machine learning models in anomaly detection and adaptive control.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For various machine learning algorithms.
*   **MQTT/Kafka:** For real-time data streaming from physical components.
*   **Docker/Kubernetes:** For containerization and orchestration of CPS components.
*   **Simulation Environments:** Tools like Gazebo or custom simulators for testing self-healing mechanisms.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karimosman89/Self-Healing-and-Adaptive-Cyber-Physical-Systems.git
   cd Self-Healing-and-Adaptive-Cyber-Physical-Systems
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python self_healing_and_adaptive_cyber_physical_systems.py
   ```

## Usage Examples

(Note: A `requirements.txt` file will be added in the next phase. For now, assume dependencies are installed.)

### Example: Basic Anomaly Detection in a Simulated Sensor Network

```python
# self_healing_and_adaptive_cyber_physical_systems.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Simulate sensor data (e.g., temperature readings)
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.normal(loc=25, scale=2, size=(100, 1)) # Normal readings
data = np.vstack((data, np.random.normal(loc=40, scale=5, size=(10, 1)))) # Anomalies

# Train an Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1, random_state=42)
model.fit(data)

# Predict anomalies (-1 for anomaly, 1 for normal)
anomalies = model.predict(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Detected anomalies: {np.where(anomalies == -1)[0]}")
```

## Results and Demonstrations

This project provides a foundational example of self-healing and adaptive capabilities in CPS. The `self_healing_and_adaptive_cyber_physical_systems.py` script demonstrates basic anomaly detection using an Isolation Forest model on simulated sensor data. This showcases how a CPS can identify unusual behavior, which is the first step towards autonomous fault diagnosis and recovery. Future work will involve integrating more sophisticated self-healing algorithms and testing in complex, real-world CPS environments.

## Future Work

*   Develop advanced fault diagnosis mechanisms using AI and expert systems.
*   Implement robust self-recovery strategies, including dynamic reconfiguration and component replacement.
*   Integrate with real-world CPS platforms (e.g., industrial control systems, smart grids).
*   Explore reinforcement learning for optimal adaptive control and resilience.
*   Conduct comprehensive security testing to validate self-healing capabilities against cyberattacks.
